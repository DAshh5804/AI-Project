# Introduction
This project leverages NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) to train a self-driving car agent. The agent learns by evolving neural networks over generations to navigate a track using feedback from sensors. We use Pygame to visualize the simulation in real-time.

# Setup & Installation
## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x
2. Pygame library
3. NEAT-Python library

## Steps
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# Usage
1. Run the model
   ```python .\Code\model.py```

# Simulation details
## Car Sensors:
Each car is equipped with sensors that collect data from the environment. This data helps the neural network predict the carâ€™s next move.

## Neural Network Architecture:
The NEAT algorithm evolves neural networks by mutating topologies and adjusting weights over generations.

## Simulation Logic:
* Cars are initialized at the start line.
* For each car, the neural network outputs decisions (e.g., increase speed, rotate).
* If a car crashes or stops moving effectively, its fitness score stops increasing.
* The simulation ends when all cars crash or time runs out (30 seconds per generation).
